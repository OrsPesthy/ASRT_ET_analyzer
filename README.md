# ASRT_ET_analyzer

## Credits

This code is heavily based on this github repository: [https://github.com/tzolnai/project_ET_zero](https://github.com/tzolnai/Child_ASRT_eye_tracking).

Orsolya Pesthy (@OrsPesthy) changed the code to be somewhat less hard-coded, and added code to create different databases for different analyses.

Tamás Zolnai (@tzolnai) wrote the bases of the code adapted to eye-tracking data.

Emese Szegedi-Hallgató (@hallgatoemese) wrote the initial ASRT script used for registering reaction times based on keyboard input.
